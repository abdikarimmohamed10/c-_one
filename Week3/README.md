## Decision Structures and the if Statement

A control structure controls the order in which statements execute.
A decision structure executes statements only when a certain condition is true.

The if statement is used to check a condition.

## The if-else Statement

The if-else statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

## Nested Decision Structures

Nested decision structures are used to check more than one condition.
Nested means one decision structure inside another.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to connect or reverse conditions.

- && (AND): Both conditions must be true.
- || (OR): One or both conditions must be true.
- ! (NOT): Reverses the Boolean value.

## bool Variables and Flags

A bool variable stores only two values: true or false.
A flag is a variable that signals whether a certain condition exists in a program.

## Comparing Strings

Strings can be compared using relational operators and methods.

- == compares two strings.
- != checks if two strings are different.
- String.Compare() compares two strings.

## Preventing Data Conversion Exceptions with TryParse

The TryParse method is used to prevent exceptions when users enter invalid data.

Examples:
- int.TryParse()
- double.TryParse()
- decimal.TryParse()

The out keyword specifies the target variable that receives the converted value.

## Input Validation

Input validation is the process of checking user input to make sure it is valid before using it.

TryParse checks whether input can be converted, while input validation checks whether the value is reasonable.

## Radio Buttons and Check Boxes

- RadioButton: Allows the user to select only one option from several choices.

- CheckBox: Allows the user to select multiple options.

The Checked property determines whether a control is selected or not.

## The switch Statement

The switch statement is used to select one action from multiple choices based on a variable or expression.

- case: Defines a possible value.
- break: Ends the current case.
- default: Executes when no case matches.

## Introduction to List Boxes

A ListBox displays a list of items and allows the user to select an item.

Common properties and methods:

- Text: Gets the text of the selected item.
- Items: Contains the items in the ListBox.
- Items.Count: Gets the total number of items.
- SelectedItem: Gets the selected item.
- SelectedIndex: Gets the index of the selected item.
- Items.Add(): Adds an item.
- Items.Remove(): Removes a specific item.
- Items.RemoveAt(): Removes an item using its index.
- Items.Clear(): Removes all items.
