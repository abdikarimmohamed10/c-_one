## While Loop

A while loop is used to repeat a statement or group of statements as long as a condition is true.

## Structure of a while Loop

A while loop has two parts:

- Boolean expression: Checks whether the condition is true or false.
- Loop body: Contains the statements that are repeated.

## Pretest Loop

A while loop is a pretest loop because it checks the condition before executing the statements.

## Infinite Loop

An infinite loop is a loop that continues running because its condition never becomes false.

## Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment increases a variable's value by 1.

Decrement decreases a variable's value by 1.

- ++ : Increases by 1.
- -- : Decreases by 1.

## Postfix and Prefix Mode

Postfix: Uses the old value first, then changes it.

Prefix: Changes the value first, then uses it.

## For Loop

A for loop is used when the number of repetitions is controlled by a counter variable.

A for loop has three parts:

- Initialization: Sets the starting value.
- Test: Checks the condition.
- Update: Increases or decreases the counter.

## Do-While Loop

A do-while loop executes the statements first and checks the condition afterward.

It always executes at least once.

## Using Files for Data Storage

Files are used to save data for later use.

There are three main steps:

- Open the file.
- Process the file.
- Close the file.

## Types of Files

Text File: Contains data stored as readable text.

Binary File: Contains data that is not stored as readable text.

## File Accessing

A file object is an object associated with a specific file that allows a program to work with that file.

## Two important classes are:

- StreamWriter: Used to write data to a text file.
- StreamReader: Used to read data from a text file.

## Writing Data to a File

Writing data means storing information in a file.

- File.CreateText(): Creates a new text file. If the file exists, its contents are erased.
- File.AppendText(): Adds new data to an existing file.
- Write(): Writes data without a new line.
- WriteLine(): Writes data and moves to a new line.
- Close(): Closes the file.

## Reading Data from a File

Reading data means getting information from a file.

Common methods include:

- File.OpenText(): Opens a text file for reading.
- Read(): Reads characters from a file.
- ReadLine(): Reads one line from a file.
- ReadToEnd(): Reads all remaining content.
- File.ReadAllText(): Reads all text from a file.
- Close(): Closes the file.

## Reading a File with a Loop

- A loop can be used to read data from a file until the end of the file is reached.

- EndOfStream is a Boolean property that checks whether the end of the file has been reached.

## OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog Controls

These controls allow an application to display standard Windows dialog boxes for opening and saving files.

- OpenFileDialog: Displays a dialog box for selecting and opening a file.

- SaveFileDialog: Displays a dialog box for selecting where to save a file.

## ShowDialog() Method

The ShowDialog() method displays a dialog box and allows the user to select an option.

## DialogResult

DialogResult indicates which button the user clicks to close the dialog box.

- DialogResult.OK: The user clicks OK.
- DialogResult.Cancel: The user clicks Cancel.

## FileName Property

The FileName property stores the path and name of the selected file.

## InitialDirectory Property

The InitialDirectory property specifies the folder that appears first when the dialog box opens.
